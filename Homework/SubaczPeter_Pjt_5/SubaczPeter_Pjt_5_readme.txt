    This contains three different ray tracing models implemented 
    within the fragment shader. Each program can be accessed pressing 
    the button labeled 'Image 1', 'Image 2', and 'Image 3'.

Image 1: Contains two spheres sitting on a reflective plane. The left 
    one sphere is partially reflective and shows a specular highlight
    The other sphere. Both spheres cast shadows onto the plane, and 
    the left sphere casts a shadow onto the right sphere.

Image 2: Contains four spheres of different colors that all reflect one 
    another. Each reflection should in turn show at least one more level
    of reflection, and all spheres should include a specular highlight.

Image 3: Contains two spheres sitting inside a box. Both spheres cast 
    shadows on the floor and walls. At least one sphere is completely
    reflective and shows the other sphere and the box walls.
