Textures:
-Upon initialization, textures are pulled from WPI. The program will render the 
  mobile with color backgrounds until the textures load. Once all textures are 
  loaded they are configured and passed fragment shader to be used downstream. 
  When textures are being rendered, they are tiled to a walls and floor using 
  texture coordinates that repeat the texture. This results in a tiling effect 
  that reduces the stretching of each texture. Textures can be toggled on/off 
  with the B key.

Shadows:
